    Everyone talks the benefits of having an automated monitoring system in place - one which can discover
    infrastructure components as they are added, monitor them while they are alive and stop monitoring when
    they are moved out. But no one has chronicled their journey through the process of automating a manually
    maintained monitoring system and showcased their battle scars for others to learn from. Thatâ€™s what
    we are going to talk about.
