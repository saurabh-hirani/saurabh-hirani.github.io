I've been working with the [icinga2 API](http://docs.icinga.org/icinga2/snapshot/doc/module/icinga2/chapter/icinga2-api) 
recently and find it to be very useful for doing command line icinga2 operations. 

My experiences with it led to the following 2 projects:

  1. [icinga2 API examples](https://github.com/saurabh-hirani/icinga2-api-examples)
  2. [icinga2 API python library and command line utility](https://github.com/saurabh-hirani/icinga2_api)

Both build on the very well documented icinga2 API and try to take its usability up a notch.
