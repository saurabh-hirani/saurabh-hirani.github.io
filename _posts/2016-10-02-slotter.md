Wrote a nifty little tool - slotter - to slot items into pre-defined slots.

Check out the [github repo](https://github.com/saurabh-hirani/slotter) for the code, use cases and examples.

Here's a sample run:

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/2wttc358zdx1mg1wkh4t7tcg8.js" id="asciicast-2wttc358zdx1mg1wkh4t7tcg8" async></script>

Try it out, pip it up and let me know your thoughts.
