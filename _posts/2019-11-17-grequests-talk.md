I wrote a two-part series on an interesting concurrency issue I ran into while 
working with grequests and gevent.

Read Part-I [here](http://saurabh-hirani.github.io/writing/2019/03/01/grequests-https-part-1).

Read Part-II [here](http://saurabh-hirani.github.io/writing/2019/04/01/grequests-https-part-2).

I gave a talk on the above at PyCon Singapore 2019. Checkout the video [here](https://youtu.be/gsRDYi40MsU).
