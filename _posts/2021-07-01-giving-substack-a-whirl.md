If you are reading this, then you truly have good taste and appreciate the finer
things in life. Seriousness apart, dear reader, I wanted to update you that I am giving
[substack](https://saurabhhirani.substack.com/) a shot to host my tech writings.

Why am I doing it:

- Maybe having an audience will make me want to write more.

I want to get better at it and your feedback can help me correct course.

Please subscribe to my newsletter [here](https://saurabhhirani.substack.com/about).

Now that you've subscribed to it and as we spoke about finer things and newsletters - I leave
you with some good news. Here's a fine video about a letter.
